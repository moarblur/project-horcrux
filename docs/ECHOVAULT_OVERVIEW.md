**[First Draft] Project Document: EchoVault**

**Tagline:** Seal your memories, share on your terms.

### üìù **Project Naming & Branding Note**

"EchoVault" is the current working title. A final name and associated branding guidelines will be developed and documented separately as the project matures. Community input will be welcomed during that process.

-----

### üöÄ Project Overview

EchoVault is conceived as a privacy-first digital platform dedicated to the secure capture, encryption, and controlled sharing of personal thoughts, memories, secrets, or reflections ‚Äì termed "Horcruxes." Each Horcrux is designed as a context-rich, encrypted payload. Users retain absolute control, deciding precisely when, with whom, and for how long this sensitive information is shared, with the ability to revoke access at any time.

The platform aims to serve individuals who prioritize emotional transparency and connection but refuse to compromise on personal privacy, trust, or control over their digital narrative. EchoVault provides an immutable record of disclosures, ensuring users always know what was shared, with whom, and the context surrounding it. Our core principle is **zero-knowledge encryption**, meaning EchoVault servers never have access to the unencrypted content of your Horcruxes.

### üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

  * **Frontend**: React (with Tailwind CSS) - Chosen for its component-based architecture, enabling a responsive and maintainable UI.
  * **Backend**: Flask (Python) - Selected for its simplicity, flexibility as a microservice framework, and the rich Python ecosystem for cryptography and web tasks. Handles API requests, metadata storage, and notification orchestration.
  * **Storage**:
      * Metadata & Encrypted Payloads: MongoDB (production) or SQLite (local development) - Chosen for flexible schema handling. Encrypted content is stored as ciphertext blobs.
      * Future (V2+): Potential integration with IPFS for decentralized storage options.
  * **Encryption**:
      * Client-Side: WebCrypto API in the browser for robust, standard-based zero-knowledge encryption/decryption using user-derived keys (passphrases).
      * Server-Side: PyNaCl library for managing any necessary server-side symmetric key operations securely (e.g., related to secure links, *not* user content).
  * **Notifications**: SMTP for email notifications and WebSockets for real-time in-app alerts.
  * **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated linting, testing, and potentially deployment pipelines.
  * **Deployment**: Docker-compose for easy local development setup; a Kubernetes Helm chart is planned for scalable production deployments.

**High‚ÄëLevel Data Flow:**

1.  User composes a Horcrux in the browser.
2.  Content is encrypted client-side using the user's passphrase (key is never sent to the server).
3.  Encrypted ciphertext and non-sensitive metadata (title, tags, recipient info) are sent to the backend API.
4.  Backend stores ciphertext and metadata in the database.
5.  Backend generates secure sharing links or triggers notifications (email/WebSocket) for recipients.
6.  Recipient accesses the link/notification.
7.  Backend serves the ciphertext to the recipient's client upon successful authentication/authorization.
8.  Recipient's browser decrypts the content locally using a shared secret or mechanism (details TBD, could involve passphrase exchange out-of-band or other E2EE methods).
9.  The backend records access and other relevant events in an immutable audit log.

### üéØ Core MVP Features (V1.0)

1.  **Horcrux Creation & Encryption:**
      * Interface to compose a title, main body text, and optional tags (e.g., emotion, event type, version).
      * Client-side, zero-knowledge encryption tied to a user-specific passphrase before any data leaves the browser.
2.  **Recipient Assignment & Secure Delivery:**
      * Ability to assign recipients via email address or platform username.
      * Generation of secure, unique links for accessing the encrypted Horcrux.
      * Option for in-app notifications (via WebSockets) or email alerts to recipients.
3.  **Access Audit & Notifications:**
      * Immutable, real-time logs recording key events: Horcrux creation, sharing, first view attempt (timestamp, recipient ID, action).
      * Optional notification (email or in-app) sent to the creator upon the first successful access by a recipient.
4.  **Revocation & Expiry Controls:**
      * Manual "Revoke Access" button allowing creators to immediately invalidate sharing links for specific recipients or all recipients of a Horcrux.
      * Option to set an expiry date/time *or* a maximum view count, after which the Horcrux becomes automatically inaccessible.

-----

### üó∫Ô∏è Nice-to-Have Features (V2.0+)

  * **Dead-Man Switch:** Automated release of designated Horcruxes to pre-assigned recipients if the creator's account shows inactivity for a configurable period.
  * **Relationship Graph:** A visual representation showing which Horcruxes (or fragments) have been shared with which contacts.
  * **Mobile Applications:** Native iOS/Android apps with features like push notifications and biometric authentication (Fingerprint/Face ID) for enhanced security and usability.
  * **Blockchain Anchoring (Optional):** Timestamping Horcrux metadata hashes on a public blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum L2) for proof-of-existence and tamper evidence, while keeping encrypted data securely off-chain.
  * **IPFS Integration:** Option to store encrypted Horcrux payloads on the InterPlanetary File System for decentralized persistence.

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Local Development)

**Prerequisites:**

  * Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
  * Python (v3.9 or later recommended)
  * pip (Python package installer)
  * Git
  * Docker & Docker Compose (Optional, but recommended for easy setup)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/moarblur/project-horcrux.git
    cd project-horcrux
    ```
2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python3 -m venv venv          # Create a virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate      # Activate (Linux/macOS)
    # or `.\venv\Scripts\activate` # Activate (Windows)
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Install backend dependencies
    # Copy .env.example to .env and fill in necessary values (DB connection, secrets)
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your configuration
    flask run                     # Start the backend server
    ```
3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install                   # Install frontend dependencies
    npm start                     # Start the frontend dev server
    ```
4.  **Docker Setup (Alternative):**
      * Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
      * From the project root directory (`echovault`):
        ```bash
        # Copy backend/.env.example to backend/.env and configure it first
        cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
        # Edit backend/.env
        docker-compose up --build   # Build and start containers
        ```
      * This will typically start the frontend, backend, and a database container (e.g., MongoDB).

**Environment Variables:** Check the `.env.example` files in both `frontend` and `backend` directories for required configuration (API URLs, database credentials, secret keys, etc.). Create `.env` files from these examples for your local setup.
