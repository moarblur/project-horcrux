# Horcrux Specification

## Purpose
A Horcrux is an encrypted artifact that can encapsulate any type of information. The specification is agnostic to the payload's contents, allowing diverse use cases. EchoVault, for example, employs Horcruxes to store personal thoughts and memories.

## Required Fields
- **title** – short human‑readable identifier for the Horcrux
- **body** – encrypted payload (text or binary)
- **tags** – list of keywords that help categorize the Horcrux
// - **visibility** – access control setting (e.g., public, private, shared)

Additional metadata includes a unique identifier, creation and modification timestamps, and optional expiry settings.

## Metadata
Each Horcrux record stores non‑sensitive metadata alongside the ciphertext:
- `id` – unique hash or UUID
- `created_at` – timestamp of creation
- `updated_at` – last modification timestamp
- `expiry` – date/time or view limit after which the content becomes inaccessible
- `recipients` – identifiers for recipients authorized to decrypt
- `access_logs` – immutable log of access events (timestamps, user IDs, actions)

## Encryption Approach
Horcruxes use zero‑knowledge encryption as described in the project README. Client-side WebCrypto derives a symmetric key from a user passphrase, and the plaintext is encrypted before any data leaves the browser. Only ciphertext and metadata are sent to the server.
// - **Encryption Algorithm** – AES-GCM for authenticated encryption
// - **Key Derivation** – PBKDF2 with a user-provided passphrase, salt, and iteration count
// - **Integrity** – HMAC or similar mechanism to ensure ciphertext integrity
// - **Decryption** – Performed client-side using the same passphrase-derived key
// - **Key Rotation** – Optional mechanism to periodically change the encryption key without re-encrypting existing data
// - **Access Control** – Encrypted payloads can be shared with specific recipients or made public, depending on the visibility setting.

## Key Management
- User-generated passphrase derives a cryptographic key.
- The key never leaves the client. The server stores only ciphertext and metadata.
- Secure sharing links may include ephemeral secrets or tokens generated by the backend to facilitate decryption by recipients.
- Recipients must authenticate to access shared Horcruxes, ensuring only authorized users can decrypt the content.
- The backend may implement rate limiting and access controls to prevent abuse of shared links.
// - **Revocation** – Users can revoke access to shared Horcruxes, invalidating existing links and preventing further decryption.

## Access Control
- **Public** – Anyone can access and decrypt the Horcrux.
- **Private** – Only the creator can access and decrypt.
- **Shared** – Access is granted to specific recipients via secure links or tokens.
- **Expiration** – Horcruxes can be set to expire after a certain date/time or number of views, automatically revoking access.
- **Audit Logging** – All access events are logged immutably, including timestamps, user IDs, and actions taken (e.g., view, edit, delete).
- **Access Policies** – Fine-grained policies can be defined to control who can view, edit, or share the Horcrux based on user roles or groups.

## User Interface
- **Creation** – Simple form to enter title, body, and tags. Optionally set visibility and expiry.
- **Viewing** – Display decrypted content with metadata. Allow editing of title, tags, and visibility settings.
- **Editing** – Users can update the title, tags, and visibility settings. The body remains encrypted.

- **Data Export** – Allow users to export Horcruxes in a standard format (e.g., JSON, XML) for backup or migration purposes.
- **Data Import** – Enable users to import existing Horcruxes from other systems or formats, ensuring compatibility with the Horcrux specification.

## Backend Requirements

- **API** – Provide a RESTful or GraphQL API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting Horcruxes.
- **Authentication** – Implement user authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to secure access to the API.
- **Rate Limiting** – Prevent abuse of the API by implementing rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.    
- **Data Integrity** – Ensure that the server cannot tamper with the ciphertext or metadata. Use cryptographic hashes to verify data integrity.
- **Data Backup** – Regularly back up encrypted data and metadata to prevent loss while maintaining encryption integrity.
- **Data Retention** – Implement policies for data retention and deletion, allowing users to manage their Horcruxes effectively. 
- **Data Migration** – Facilitate migration of Horcruxes between different storage backends or services, ensuring compatibility with the Horcrux specification.
- **Data Synchronization** – Keep Horcruxes synchronized across multiple devices or platforms, ensuring users have access to their data wherever they are.

## Client Requirements
- **Web Application** – A browser-based interface for creating, viewing, and managing Horcruxes.
- **Mobile Application** – A native or hybrid app for accessing Horcruxes on mobile devices.
- **Encryption Library** – Use WebCrypto API or a similar library for client-side encryption and decryption.

## Data Flow
1. User creates a Horcrux in the client application.
2. The client encrypts the payload using a passphrase-derived key.
3. The encrypted payload and metadata are sent to the backend via a secure API.
4. The backend stores the ciphertext and metadata securely.
5. The backend generates a unique identifier for the Horcrux and returns it to the client.
6. The client displays the Horcrux in the user interface, allowing further actions (view, edit, share).
7. When a user accesses a Horcrux, the client retrieves the ciphertext and metadata from the backend.
8. The client decrypts the ciphertext using the passphrase-derived key.
9. The decrypted content is displayed to the user, along with metadata (title, tags, creation date).
10. If the Horcrux is shared, the client generates a secure link or token for recipients.
11. Recipients access the secure link, authenticate, and retrieve the ciphertext.
12. Recipients decrypt the ciphertext locally using the shared secret or passphrase.

## Sharing Flow
1. The creator writes a Horcrux in the browser.
2. Content is encrypted locally using the passphrase-derived key.
3. The encrypted payload and metadata are uploaded to the backend.
4. The backend generates a secure link and optionally notifies recipients.
5. Recipients access the link, authenticate, and retrieve the ciphertext.
6. Recipients decrypt locally with the shared secret or passphrase.
7. Access events are logged immutably for auditing.
